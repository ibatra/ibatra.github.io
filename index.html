        <h2>Research and Publications</h2>

        <p> My research interests include NLP and Machine Learning! The following is a brief summary of paper(s) I've worked on:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Learn Languages First and Then Convert: Towards Effective Simplified to Traditional Chinese Conversion</b></li>
          <p><i>Pranav A, S.F. Hui, Ishaan Batra, I-Tsun Cheng and Chiu Yik Hei</i></p>
          <p>
            Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese Character conversion is a common pre-processing step in Chinese NLP. Our proposed method achieved a near-perfect
            disambiguation accuracy of 99.98%, outperforming previous Chinese Character Conversion approaches by over 5 points in accuracy. <b>Our paper was accepted at NAACL-SRW.</b>
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p> I am currently working on some more projects in this field at the moment so stay tuned for more!</p>

        <!-- <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p> -->
        <h2> Projects </h2>
        <p>I like to do fun stuff! Here are some projects I've worked on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>COMP4461(Human-Computer Interaction) Project 1 </b></li>
            <p><i>Group Name: Basketcase</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Brainstorming Phase</b></li>
              Our group sat down and tried to list as many existing projects or topics that is related to sustainability projects. As a group that loves food, 
              we decided to choose reducing foodwaste as our problem to tackle. Suprisingly, there were many projects which were school driven.

              <li><b>Existing Projects</b></li>
              <ul>
                <li>In some Halls like TKO, there are food sharing cabinets where student could put preserved/canned intems and donate them to other people. 
                This project however is limited to preserved goods, and doesn't show what items are currently on display.</li>
                <li>In LG7 and LG1 canteen, there are options to order with less rice with a 1 HKD discount. This however limits the option only
                to rice, and not on other items.</li>
                <li>HKUST also had an bring a lunchbox today campaign, but not everyone had the time or resource to bring a lunchbox to campus.</li>
              </ul>
              <li><b>Designs</b></li>
              <div class="img-zoom-container">
                  <img id="storyboard" src="stylesheets/storyboard.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Girl">

              <p>After discussing about different ways to reduce food waste, we tried to focus on groups that cooked.
              As a student who regularly cooks, I always had the problem where it is very awkward to portion my groceries. We had several designs, 
              and one that I worked on, was grosharies, an app that makes sharing groceries simple. 
              Dohoon drew this storyboard, and we all went around to ask for opinions. The feedback had been overwhelmingly positive with only minor concerns.</p>
              <li><b>Grosharies</b></li>
              <p>In the end, we chose the grosharies as our final idea as it had in our opinion was the most viable option, and had a far reaching potential meant for more than just UST students. 
                We have agreed that the core functionality would be a intuitive interface to allow people with excess groceries to share, 
                and buyers to locate and identify the goods quickly and easily. I implemented the app prototype in a week which great influenced the feedback and the other members thought it was brilliant!</p>
              <li><b>Reflection</b></li>
              During this course I learnt a lot about rapid prototyping. We had to come up with multiple designs really fast and weigh in quick on which design
              is the most viable option. All the ideas were equally enticing at first but by weighing them against each other we managed to choose
              what we thought was the best option. We also learnt that parallel prototyping works better in practice compared to serial protoyping in the course of our
              project. I also thought storyboarding was a fun process and definitely gave more insight into the design and cater better to needs. Due to the short
              timeline of the project it did feel a little overwhelimng at times, however, I am really grateful to my teammates for making this a highly educational
              and fun project to do.
              It was certainly challenging coming up with a prototype in less than a week and we certainly did get our hands dirty doing that.

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>

          </tr>
          <tr>
