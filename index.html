        <h1>Hi, I'm Ishaan!</h1>

        <p><em>Welcome to my page!</em></p>

        <p>
          I am an undergraduate student studying <b>Computer Engineering(CPEG)</b> at <b>Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST)</b>. 
          
          <!-- [Link to another page](./another-page.html). -->
          
          My programming interests primarily lie in <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>NLP</b>. I am also interested in <b>Graphic Design</b>
          and am proficient in <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> and <b>Illustrator</b>.
          </p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>

        <p> During my undergraduate life, I have also taken up various internships and the following is a brief summary of my previous internships:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Dayta AI Ltd.</b></li>
          <p><i>Machine Learning Engineer</i></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Used models such as BERT/ELMo to develop Chinese Paraphrasing tools</li> 
            <li>Part of a 5 perso team responsible for developing a new state-of-the-art Chinese Tokenizer, which outperformed existing models.</li>
            <li>Worked on person recognition and headcount tracker projects, including doing transfer learning to fine-tune existing implementations</li>
            <li>Developed various in-house tools to create datasets to retrain computer vision models</li>
            <li>Completed many projects with a short turnaround time</li>
          </ul>
          <li><b>First Code Academy</b></li>
          <p><i>STEM Instructor</i></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Instructor for Intro to Python and MIT App Inventor courses</li> 
          </ul>
          <li><b>Infotel Business Solutions Ltd.</b></li>
          <p><i>Web Development Intern</i></p>
          <ul>
              <li>Received training in Full-Stack programming with emphasis on frontend development</li>
              <li>Assisted in debugging and quality testing of programs</li> 
          </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research and Publications</h2>

        <p> My research interests include NLP and Machine Learning! The following is a brief summary of paper(s) I've worked on:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><b>Learn Languages First and Then Convert: Towards Effective Simplified to Traditional Chinese Conversion</b></li>
          <p><i>Pranav A, S.F. Hui, Ishaan Batra, I-Tsun Cheng and Chiu Yik Hei</i></p>
          <p>
            Simplified Chinese to Traditional Chinese Character conversion is a common preprocess-ing step in Chinese NLP. Our proposed method achieved a near-perfect
            disambiguation accuracy of 99.98%, outperforming previous Chinese Character Conversion approaches by over 5 points in accuracy. <b>Our paper was accepted at NAACL-SRW.</b>
          </p>
        </ul>
        <p> I am currently working on some more projects in this field at the moment so stay tuned for more!</p>

        <h2> Projects </h2>

        <!-- <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Crazy linking action</h2>
